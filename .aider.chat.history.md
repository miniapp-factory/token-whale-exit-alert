#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the exported `title` and `description` values to match the new app information.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to describe the logo image that should be generated.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A stylized whale silhouette in deep blue against a subtle gradient background, with a glowing, translucent token icon floating above its head. The whale’s body is sleek and dynamic, suggesting movement and monitoring, while the token icon represents cryptocurrency. The overall composition conveys real‑time tracking of whale activity in the crypto market, with a clean, modern aesthetic suitable for a dashboard logo.
